# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# yarn
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# yarn
yarn build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# yarn
yarn preview
```

## Custom FontAwesome component

I've added custom FontAwesome component to avoid console errors that an icon has not been found.
The component only shows the icon when the view is mounted.
It's probably not the most elegant solution but hey, it works, and that's all I need for template project :)

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
